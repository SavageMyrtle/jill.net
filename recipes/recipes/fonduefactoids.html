The texture is marvellous, but on the one occasion I tried this, I found the flavour oddly faded.</td>

Turn up the heat, throw in the rest of your grated cheese and some wine, stirring energetically all the while. If, on the other hand, you have no cheese left, you'd better make sure you've planned something for <a href="../../recipes/desserts.html">afters</a>.</td>

                <td>If you feel like <b>ringing the changes</b>, why not try cider or champagne instead of white wine. You could also add a handful of finely chopped shallots, diced ham, chopped fresh herbs, green peppercorns, or a little bit of blue cheese.</td>

Try buttered toast, blanched vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, baby sweetcorn, celery sticks or spring onions) or tomato wedges and mushrooms. If you're really adventurous, you could even try dipping apple, pear or pineapple slices (ughhhhhhhh... I hate fruit).</td>

			<tr>
				<td valign="top">8.</td>
				<td>If you need something to <b>nibble</b> before you get down to business, traditional <i>amuse-gueules</i> include small silverskin onions, cornichons (gherkins) and dried meat. The latter might sound alarming, but it's just a kind of ham, really. Salami, Parma ham... anything like that will do. But make sure it's good quality.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top">9.</td>
				<td><b>DON'T</b>, whatever you do, <b>drink water</b> with your fondue. The cheese will congeal into an enormous ball in your stomach; you won't be able to sleep, go to the toilet, or dream of ever eating another fondue as long as you live. If you can't or won't, drink wine, have some hot black tea instead.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top">10.</td>
				<td>And finally, real hard-core fondue eaters do the "<b>coup du milieu</b>". This means having an extra wine glass by your plate, containing kirsch. Before dipping your cubes of bread into the cheese, dip them first into the kirsch. It aids digestion and is excellent for the skin. No, really.</td>

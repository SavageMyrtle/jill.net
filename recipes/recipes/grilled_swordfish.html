	<h2>Seared swordfish with mango and avocado salsa</h2>
<hr color="Black" noshade>
<strong>Servings:</strong> 2<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 15 minutes<br>
<strong>Equipment:</strong> a cast-iron ridged grill pan that sits on top of the stove, or a heavy-based frying pan.
<hr color="Black" noshade>
<ul>
<li>2 swordfish steaks, about 1 inch thick
<li>olive oil
<li>&#189; ripe avocado
<li>1 ripe mango
<li>S & P
</ul>
<hr color="Black" noshade>
<ol>
<li>Chop the avocado and mango into smallish chunks. Put them into a bowl (with any juice that has leaked out) and stir fiercely. The result should be a sloppy, lumpy sauce. Add salt to taste.
<li>Put your grill or frying pan onto a medium-high heat and leave it to get hot. This should take 5 to 10 minutes.
<li>In the meantime, brush both sides of the swordfish steaks with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
<li>When the pan has heated up, put the swordfish in and cook for no more than two minutes on each side. Any longer and it will dry out. If it's a little raw in the middle that's fine.
<li>Serve over a pool of the avocado and mango salsa.
</ol>
<p>I ate something like this at a restaurant in Sydney, somewhere near the Harbour Bridge, and determined to try doing it myself one day. On 20th March, 1999, for the first time ever, I found ripe avocadoes, ripe mangoes and swordfish steaks in my local supermarket <i>all on the same day</i>! The probability of finding even one of these is infinitesimally small, so I expect I'll have to consider it a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>

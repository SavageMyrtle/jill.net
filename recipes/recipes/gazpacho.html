<h2>Gazpacho andaluz</h2>
<hr noshade color="#000000">
<strong>Warning:</strong>
 This is a work in progress. It's how I made gazpacho the first and only time I tried, after an inspiring trip to Seville. I was working off a combination of two recipes, using different equipment from what was recommended, and I'm afraid it went wrong. I put in too much vinegar. BUT - don't let that put you off. I'll leave the amount of vinegar to your discretion and I'm sure it'll work brilliantly.<br>
<strong>Essential equipment:</strong>
 You'll need two large bowls, plus a blender of some sort (I used a hand-held stalk blender, but the goblet type is probably better), and preferably also a <a class="gloss" href="javascript:popup('../../reference/mouli.htm')" onmouseover="self.status='Click to see glossary entry' ;return true" onmouseout="self.status='' ;return true">mouli</a> or food mill.<br>
<strong>Servings:</strong> 4 as a starter<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> Well, it took me ages, but I guess I could get it down to 40 minutes with practice.
<hr noshade color="#000000">
<ul>
<li>4 large (but not huge) tomatoes
<li>100g cucumber
<li>&#189; onion
<li>2 small or one large green pepper
<li>2 cloves garlic, crushed
<li>80g bread crumb from a good white loaf (weighed after crusts have been removed)
<li>60ml olive oil (4 generous tbsp)
<li>a dash or two of wine vinegar (see warning above)
<li>&#188; tsp ground cumin
<li>1 tsp salt
</ul>
<hr noshade color="#000000">
<ol>
<li>Tear the bread up into small chunks, put it in a bowl and cover with cold water. Leave it to soak while you're doing the next bit.
<li>Chop all the veggies up fairly small.
<li>Blend them to a pur&eacute;e.
<li>This is where your mouli comes into its own. Pour the pur&eacute;e into your mouli (which, of course, is standing over a large bowl), turn the handle gently, and you will be left with a bowl full of smooth pinkish liquid, and a mouli full of skins and seeds. If you haven't got a mouli you'll have to rub it through a sieve, which is much more tedious. Or you could leave all the skins in, of course.
<li>Now get the blender out again, and whizz up the bread with a bit of your soup until it's smooth. What I did at this point was add the bread pur&eacute;e to the rest of the soup, with the oil, salt, cumin and vinegar, and whizz it all up until the oil was homogeneously incorporated. If you're using a goblet blender I'm afraid you're on your own here (but you could <a href="mailto:jill@jill.net?subject=How on earth did you ever make gazpacho without a proper blender">let me know how it goes</a> if you're feeling charitable).
<li>Now, this is the bit I don't understand. Both of my recipes said at this point that I should add some cold water. But there was plenty of soup there already, and the texture was just how I wanted it &#151; not too thick, not too thin. So I ignored that and just put it in the fridge until it was time to eat.

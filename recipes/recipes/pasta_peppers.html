	<h2>Pasta with roasted peppers, garlic and basil</h2>
<hr color="black" noshade>
<strong>Servings:</strong> 2<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> &frac12; hour
<hr color="black" noshade>
		1 chunky red pepper<br>
		1 chunky yellow pepper<br>
		10 or so fresh basil leaves, torn up<br>
		2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br>
		2 cloves garlic, peeled<br>

		2 oz freshly grated parmesan<br>
		8 oz / 250 g pasta, or however much you usually use for 2 people. Tubular pasta such as penne or rigatoni would be best here.

<li>Cut the peppers lengthways along their grooves, remove the core and white bits, then peel the pieces using a vegetable peeler. Cut them into &frac12;-inch / 1 cm strips, then cut these strips in half to make them shorter. (This recipe is by Marcella Hazan, the original anally-retentive chef)
<li>Saut&eacute; the whole garlic cloves in the olive oil until they turn a light nut brown, then discard them.
<li>Add the peppers to the pan and cook them on a medium-high heat for 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are tender but not mushy. Add salt, stir, and remove from the heat. Gently reheat just before you're ready to serve.
<li>Cook the pasta.
<li>When the pasta is about ready to drain, melt the butter in a small saucepan, or in a bowl in the microwave (it should be just runny, not sizzling). Toss the drained pasta with the peppers, add the melted butter, parmesan and basil leaves and toss thoroughly.

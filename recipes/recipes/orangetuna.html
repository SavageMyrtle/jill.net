        <td>I was surprised how tasty this was. It makes a very easy and delicious first course. I hate capers, but I put them in anyway, and I didn't regret it. They add a mild sort of tanginess, if you see what I mean. The only problem I had with this was that the oranges were full of chewy bits and pips. Maybe I had the wrong type of orange. I got the recipe from <a href="http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/">Sainsbury's</a> excellent site. Notice I didn't mention that at the top of the page. If I had you would no doubt have left this poor excuse for a web site, never to return.</td>
